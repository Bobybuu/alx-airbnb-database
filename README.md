# 🏡 ALX Airbnb Database Project

This repository contains the complete solution for the **ALX Airbnb Database Module**, which simulates the backend of an Airbnb-like system. The focus of the project is to apply advanced database design techniques, normalization, schema creation, and data seeding using SQL.

---

## 📘 Project Overview

This project is part of a comprehensive ALX software engineering training and aims to build a robust, normalized, and scalable **relational database** for an Airbnb-style application. It mimics a real-world production-level system, emphasizing clean design, data integrity, and optimal performance.

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you will:

- Design a relational database using professional ERD tools.
- Normalize data to the **Third Normal Form (3NF)** to eliminate redundancy.
- Use **SQL DDL** to define schema with proper keys, constraints, and indexes.
- Populate the database with **realistic sample data** using DML statements.
- Follow best practices in collaboration, documentation, and version control.

---

## ✅ Project Requirements

To successfully complete the tasks in this repository, you should:

- Be proficient in **SQL** and **Relational Databases**.
- Understand data modeling and normalization up to **3NF**.
- Use visual tools like **Draw.io** for ERD creation.
- Be familiar with **Git** and **GitHub** for project management and versioning.

## 📌 Project Tasks & Structure

| Task No. | Description | Directory | File(s) |
|---------:|-------------|-----------|---------|
| 0 | **Define Entities and Relationships** <br> - Create an ERD showing entities (User, Property, Booking, etc.) and relationships. | `ERD/` | `requirements.md`, `README.md` |
| 1 | **Normalize Database Design** <br> - Apply normalization up to 3NF and explain the steps. | Root | `normalization.md` |
| 2 | **Design Database Schema (DDL)** <br> - Write `CREATE TABLE` scripts with constraints and indexes. | `database-script-0x01/` | `schema.sql`, `README.md` |
| 3 | **Seed Database with Sample Data** <br> - Insert realistic sample data for users, properties, bookings, and payments. | `database-script-0x02/` | `seed.sql`, `README.md` |
| 4 | **Manual Review Submission** <br> - Submit the ERD and documentation for evaluation. | `ERD/` | `README.md` |
